## What is Key Exchange?

KEX or key-exchange is one of the most fundamental protocols for secure data sharing on the internet. I had Gemini AI describe it like this:

´alice has a secret key and a pub key.
bob has a secret key and a pub key.

alice sends her pub key to bob.
bob sends his pub key to alice.

alice uses her secret key and bob's pub key to make a shared secret key.
bob uses his secret key and alice's pub key to make the same shared secret key.

Now alice and bob have a shared secret key.´

That shared key is used to encrypt all application data after a TLS handshake between a client ( e.g you browser ) and a server. TLS is 'Transport Layer Security' is a sublayer of the communication tunnel between client and server.

So how can TLS become quantum safe when both parties must send their public keys to one other? Well with Diffie-Hellman key exchange the public keys are RSA encrypted. Although the secrey key is AES encrypted which is quantum safe, RSA is not quantum safe.

I wanted to see if we could implement post quantum cryptography into an nginx server and make the TLS hanshake quantum safe.

 ## The Stack ## 

A production-ready post-quantum cryptography (PQC) enabled nginx server with Node.js backend in a conatiner. This setup integrates Open Quantum Safe (OQS) libraries for hybrid traditional + post-quantum TLS encryption. Implementing PQC on nginx was going to be a valuable lesson on what tools already exist and how we can upgrade the foundation of all client server communication.

Learning outcomes:
- How can we utilise the Open Quantum Safe tooling
- How can we get Crystals-Kyber into an Nginx server for TLS
- How can we test that our pqc cipher is being used

"The Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project is an open-source project that aims to support the transition to quantum-resistant cryptography."

And they have a docker image available on their github, awesome!

## The Architecture

**Routing**: OQS-enabled nginx reverse proxy (HTTP port 8080, HTTPS port 8443)
**Backend**: Node.js Express API server (internal port 3000)
**Containerization**: Docker Compose orchestrates both services
**Security**: Post-quantum certificates with hybrid cipher suites (ML-DSA-44, X25519MLKEM768)

## Hybrid Cryptography Explained

One of the most importan fators in this switch to post quantum cryptography has been termed 'crypto agility'. This means that implmementors will need to be able to write new code into systems which can elegantly co-exist with current implementations. Why? So that current systems do not break and the migrations happen with as little headache as possible. Harnessing OQS in this project will give us crypto agility out of the box without having to write any new code.

### Two Types of "Hybrid" in This Setup

We will build with this in mind. These are the exchanges we will offer.

### Client Connection Examples

Client Type | Request Method | Key Exchange | Signature | Security Level |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
|    OQS Client (Explicit PQ) | `--curves X25519MLKEM768` | X25519MLKEM768 | mldsa44 | Full Quantum-Safe |
| OQS Client (Auto) | No curve specified | X25519 | RSA-PSS | Classical Fallback |
| Traditional Browser | Standard HTTPS | X25519 | RSA-PSS | Classical Security |

Important thing to note here is `--curves X25519MLKEM768` MLKEM768 is CRYTALS-KYBER with 768 security level on par with AES-192. 768 has to do with the internal maths of the algorithm, not the key size.

## Post-Quantum Cryptography Features

### ✅ Let's Implement
- **Hybrid Key Exchange Algorithm**: X25519MLKEM768 (simultaneous classical + post-quantum protection)

KEM is slightly different to traditional Diffie-Hellman, in that the public key is encapsulated into a ciphertext and a shared key, this ciphertext it sent back to the client. [This explains it well](https://medium.com/identity-beyond-borders/crystals-kyber-the-key-to-post-quantum-encryption-3154b305e7bd).

- Our pqc certificates will be made using ML-DSA-44 (NIST standardized quantum-safe digital signatures) and our symmetric key will be AES-256-GCM, AES 256 is already quantumm safe and will never leave the server.

Wem will make sure we can present both RSA and ML-DSA-44 certificates based on client capabilities

### Security Status
This Hybrid algorithm approach will provide protection against both classical and quantum attacks. Clients can explicitly request post-quantum algorithms for full quantum safety and traditional clients will automatically fall back to secure classical algorithms, allowing 'Readyness' for widespread post-quantum adoption with smooth migration path.


## Building the Project

Let's build this step by step. You'll need Docker installed on your machine.

### Project Structure
```
pqc-nginx/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── nginx-conf/
│   └── nginx.conf
├── certs/
├── backend/
│   ├── server.js
│   └── package.json
└── scripts/
    └── generate-certificates.sh
```

### Step 1: Create the Backend Server

First, let's create a simple Node.js backend to serve behind our nginx proxy:

```javascript
// backend/server.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/api/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ 
    status: 'healthy', 
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    message: 'Post-quantum nginx backend is running!' 
  });
});

app.get('/nginx-health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ 
    nginx: 'proxy working',
    backend: 'connected',
    quantum_safe: true
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Backend server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

```json
// backend/package.json
{
  "name": "pqc-backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "server.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  }
}
```

  ## During the TLS handshake

  1. Client generates both an X25519 keypair AND an MLKEM768 keypair
  2. Client sends both public keys to the server
  3. Server performs both X25519 ECDH AND MLKEM768 encapsulation
  4. Server sends back the X25519 result AND the MLKEM768 ciphertext
  5. Both sides combine the shared secrets from both algorithms into a single master secret

  The math:
  final_shared_secret = KDF(x25519_shared_secret || mlkem768_shared_secret)

  Security benefit:
  - If quantum computers break MLKEM768 → X25519 still protects you
  - If classical computers break X25519 → MLKEM768 still protects you
  - An attacker needs to break BOTH algorithms to compromise the connection

  So "hybrid" means the algorithm provides dual protection by running two different mathematical approaches in parallel, not that it chooses between them.
  The TLS connection is secured by the combination of both.

### Step 2: Configure Nginx for Post-Quantum

The key difference from regular nginx is using the OQS-enabled image and configuring quantum-safe cipher suites:

```nginx
# nginx-conf/nginx.conf
events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    include /opt/nginx/conf/mime.types;
    default_type application/octet-stream;
    
    # Upstream backend
    upstream backend {
        server backend:3000;
    }

    # HTTP server (redirect to HTTPS)
    server {
        listen 8080;
        return 301 https://$host:8443$request_uri;
    }

    # HTTPS server with post-quantum crypto
    server {
        listen 8443 ssl;
        server_name localhost;

        # Post-quantum certificates (order matters!)
        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/server_mldsa44.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/server_mldsa44.key;
        
        # Traditional fallback certificates
        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/server_rsa.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/server_rsa.key;

        # Critical: Post-quantum curve configuration
        ssl_ecdh_curve X25519MLKEM768:mlkem768:X25519:P-256;
        ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;
        
        # Security headers
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;
        ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
        ssl_session_timeout 10m;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Docker Compose Setup

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml

services:
  nginx:
    image: openquantumsafe/nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "8443:8443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx-conf/nginx.conf:/opt/nginx/nginx-conf/nginx.conf:ro
      - ./certs:/etc/nginx/certs:ro
    depends_on:
      - backend
    networks:
      - pqc-network

  backend:
    build: ./backend
    networks:
      - pqc-network
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production

networks:
  pqc-network:
    driver: bridge
```

### Step 4: Generate Post-Quantum Certificates

This is where the magic happens. We use OQS tools to create certificates with post-quantum algorithm:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/generate-certificates.sh

mkdir -p certs

# Generate post-quantum certificates (ML-DSA-44)
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/certs:/certs openquantumsafe/openssl \
  req -x509 -new -newkey mldsa44 -keyout /certs/server_mldsa44.key \
  -out /certs/server_mldsa44.crt -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost" -days 365

# Generate traditional certificates (RSA fallback)
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/certs:/certs openquantumsafe/openssl \
  req -x509 -new -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /certs/server_rsa.key \
  -out /certs/server_rsa.crt -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost" -days 365

echo "Certificates generated successfully!"
```

### Step 5: Build and Run

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/generate-certificates.sh

# Generate certificates
./scripts/generate-certificates.sh

# Build and run the stack
docker-compose up --build
```

## What Makes This Quantum-Safe?

Now let's examine the specific changes that enable post-quantum protection:

### 1. Container Choice
**Changed**: Using `openquantumsafe/nginx:latest` instead of standard nginx
**Why**: Standard nginx doesn't include OQS libraries for post-quantum algorithms

### 2. Certificate Algorithm
**Changed**: `mldsa44` instead of RSA for digital signatures
**Why**: ML-DSA-44 is NIST-standardized and quantum-resistant, while RSA can be broken by Shor's algorithm

### 3. Key Exchange Curves
**Changed**: `ssl_ecdh_curve X25519MLKEM768:mlkem768:X25519:P-256`
**Why**: X25519MLKEM768 combines classical X25519 with post-quantum MLKEM768 for hybrid protection

### 4. TLS Protocol Restriction
**Changed**: `ssl_protocols TLSv1.3` only
**Why**: Post-quantum algorithms require TLS 1.3 for proper negotiation

### 5. Certificate Ordering
**Changed**: Post-quantum certificates listed first in nginx.conf
**Why**: Nginx attempts certificate matching in order - PQ-capable clients get PQ certificates first

## Testing Your Quantum-Safe Setup

### Basic Connectivity Test
```bash
curl -k https://localhost:8443/nginx-health
```

### Post-Quantum Verification
```bash
docker run --rm --network host openquantumsafe/curl \
  curl -k -v --curves X25519MLKEM768 https://localhost:8443/nginx-health
```

**Success indicators in output:**
- `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
- `X25519MLKEM768` (hybrid key exchange)
- `mldsa44` (post-quantum signatures)

### Certificate Inspection
```bash
docker run --rm --network host openquantumsafe/openssl \
  s_client -connect localhost:8443 -servername localhost \
  -provider oqsprovider -provider default
```

The output should show `mldsa44` in the certificate signature algorithm.

## Key Learning Points

**Client-side configuration matters**: Even with a perfect PQ server, clients must explicitly request post-quantum curves using `--curves X25519MLKEM768`. Without this, connections fall back to classical algorithms.

**Hybrid provides best security**: X25519MLKEM768 runs both classical and post-quantum algorithms simultaneously. If either is compromised, the other still protects your data.

**Certificate order affects negotiation**: Nginx tries certificates in the order listed. Put post-quantum certificates first to prioritize them for capable clients.

**Migration path exists**: Traditional clients automatically fall back to RSA/ECDSA certificates, ensuring no service disruption during the transition period.

This setup provides production-ready post-quantum protection while maintaining full backward compatibility - exactly what's needed for the coming quantum transition.
