        <p>Hi, I'm Pavlos MacDonald-Kosmidis and I'm the founder of Kosmac Cyber.</p>
        <p>This is my platform for showcasing my work and services as a cryptic-coder.</p>
        <p>For your front-end let's do Angular - it is after all the superior framework for building web applications.</p>        
        <p>For your backend let's Python with FastAPI - or simply NodeJs with Express, or Rust if your gig is crypto specific.</p>
        <p>For your database let's do whatever you want, because I hate databases :)</p>
        <p>This platform will also host my blog where I will rant about technology that I hate and ramble about technology I love</p>
        <p>For AI let's do Anthropic Claude - you legend!!</p>
